            In my time at UC Berkeley, I have found a passion for mechanical design.
            I love to take advantage of all the resources I have to create and bring to life my ideas.
            Rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing are what I enjoy most because I can turn my designs into reality so quickly.

            Outside of coursework, I play the flute and piano.
            Additionally, I enjoy teaching through the school as a Graduate Student Instructor for an introductory Electrical Engineering course.

	   					<h4>Foxeye Robotics</h4>
	   					<p>I had the opportunity to work in a cutting edge startup pioneering the use of robotics, artificial intelligence and machine vision to create an entirely new category in the gigantic and lucrative beauty industry.
                I worked on numerous projects including designing and prototyping a safe end effector and designing a holder for parts that are .15mm in diameter.
                I gained extensive experience with the Form 2 SLA printer including experimentation with various materials, learning how to optimize the repeatability and resolution of the printer, and performing maintanence.

                Additionally, these tracks were designed to be 3D printed for both a small and large scale model.

                I worked on designing a 3D printed cycloidal gearbox for our Thigh-Actuated Bipedal Robot for Extreme Agility.
                I was fortunate enough to work with the Markforged 3D printer which has carbon fiber infused materials.
                Both the concepts of 3D printed planetary and cycloidal gearboxes were weighed to determine which would be preferred for this application.
                I performed tests and analysis on different materials and manufacturing methods to conclude that a planetary gearbox would not meet our requirements and therefore designed and 3D printed a cycloidal gearbox for testing.

                I also created the drawings for our custom parts to outsource in large quantities from manufacturers.

                Additionally, I explored the most cost efficent methods of acquiring and producing parts, both to make certain that we would be within budget but also to ensure that we would not spend too much of our own labor.
                We redesigned the modular kit metal used by the students for assembling their robots as well as carefully documented all of our processes to apply for grants.

					      <h4>Supplies Tray</h4>
					      <p>An important part of the robot was the supplies that needed to be swapped in and out.
                  The robot needed to be able to easily grab eyelash extensions, parts that are only 15 microns in diameter.
                  Designing a part to hold them pushed the limits of the Form 2's resolution and many revisions were made as warping and misalignment issues became clearer with such small tolerances.
                  The part was designed to hold 25 extensions in three layers, keeping them in a constant orientation with a relatively easy loading process.
                  Shoulder screws were used to both keep the layers indexed as well as clamp them together.
                  Indexing portrusions were used on the extension holders to place well located ARUCO markers to assist the robot with locating the extensions.
                  The holder as well as other parts were located and oriented very precisely to avoid collisions.
                  The tray used locating pins to be repeatedly placed accurately into bosses on the robot base.

					      <h4>Breakaway End Effectors</h4>
					      <p>The objective of this project was to design a new end effector, held onto a coupling with magnets, that would breakaway above a threshold force for safety concerns.
                  The goal was to have a stronger pull force than push force.
                  To achieve that, I helped design a coupling and end effector pairing that had a shoulder that would hook on the EF when pulling but allow it to slide off much easier when pushing.
                  The magnets were offset by a small amount to create an axial force to index the part against the shoulder properly.
                  Bumps set in a triangle groove were also used to index the coupling and EF together.
                  Several revisions were done with different bump locations and different shoulder profiles to obtain the optimal design for the end effector.

					      <h4>Cycloidal Gearbox</h4>
					      <p>The original aim of this project was to create a 3D printed planetary gearbox for a 3D printed legged robot.
                  The size constraints on the gearbox led the teeth of the spur gears very small.
                  After some static testing on the 3D printed gears, it was determined to be too weak for the gearbox's purpose.
                  With more research done, it was concluded that a cycloidal gearbox would be stronger because of its larger and therefore stronger teeth.
                  Because it is not as commonly used as spur gears, I had to read several papers to understand how to design it.

             <h4>DIY 3D Printer</h4>
             <p> I love additive manufacturing and have always wanted my own 3D printer, however I never wanted to spend money on a nice one or even a cheap one.
               I realized I could make my own that was higher quality for a lower price point while learning a lot in the process.
               I am still working on the designs of all of the components, however I hope to complete this project in a reasonable time frame.
               My initial design used an 80/20 type aluminum extrusion material for the frame, 3D printed connectors and mounts, belts and lead screws for the x,y,z motion in addition to 0.9deg stepper motors for higher resolution.
               After doing a BOM and cost analysis, even sourcing from abroad, it was a higher price than I wanted to pay.
               As a result, I decided to redesign the frame with laser cut .25" wood which would significantly reduce the cost and give me more flexibility in the printer dimensions.
               With a grant I recieved for Fall 2020, I will be building out this 3D printer as well as adding the functionality of a CNC mill later on.

					      <h4>Planting Robot</h4>
					      <p>As part of a group project to create a planting robot, I designed the system to water the plants.
                  A gravity fed watering system was implemented with a 2L bottle used for storage.
                  A bottle cap was 3D printed out of PLA,
                  and in order to prevent leaking from the cap, a gasket was 3D printed out of the compressible material TPU.
                  To route the water, a rigid polyethylene tubing was used at the entrance and exit of the solenoid valve and at the exit of the bottle cap.
                  A flexible, long silicone tubing was used to easily route the tubing and allow the bottle to flip over for refills.
                  In order to balance the pressure and ensure flow out of the solenoid valve, a check valve was installed on the bottom of the bottle for one directional flow of air into the bottle.
                  Additionally, a laser cut structure was designed and manufactured to hold the bottle upside down.
                  The solenoid valve was actuated using a transistor as as switch controlled by a microcontroller to apply a voltage across the solenoid valve.

                  <h4>The Amazing Cane</h4>
                  <p> As part of a semesster long project where we explored the entire design process, from How Might We statements to user interviews to low and high fidelity prototypes,
                    The Amazing Cane was the outcome.
                    Designed to ensure the safety of visually impaired people, The Amazing Cane is the result of many iterations exploring other ideas like robot guide dogs and using feedback from visually impaired individuals.
                    This product is an attachment to the existing white cane that notifies the users of objects above head and chest level, a pain point among users.
                    The attachment slides onto the handle of the cane and requires a screwdriver to clamp onto the cane, similar to a shaft collar.
                    Inside the attachment is an Adafruit feather, which takes input from an ultrasonic distance sensor and relays feedback to the user through a vibration motor and speaker.
                    Flashing neopixel lights are used alert others to the user.
                    In order to reduce the noise in the sensor, a median filter was employed. Additionally, a boolean flag feature was used to ensure that the audio feedback would not be running continuously.
                    The body was outsourced and SLS printed in Nylon and the attachment parts were printed using PLA.

                  <h4>Wooden Planetary Gearbox</h4>
                  <p> For a fun personal project, I wanted to see if I could make a multistage planetary gearbox using only wood.
                    There were a lot of manufacturing challenges involved making it difficult to produce greater than a two stage gearbox, though I tried for three.
                    I used dowels for the shafts and had to test different sizes of holes to get the appropriate clearance and interference fits for the shafts.
                    One challenge was constraining the gears properly so they had enough play to move smoothly but without too much that could cause them to fall out of place.
                    Another issue was the manufacturing tolerances, the gears were so small that the kerf of the laser significantly impacted the geometry of the gear, causing a lot of backlash.
                    Overall, I was pretty pleased with how it turned out.

                I designed the remote PCB with four momentary buttons and an on/off switch meant to be held in one hand.
                The circuit uses buttons and an encoder to transmit signals using an antenna to a board on the car which will recieve and decode the signals.
                Those signals will then be sent to the motor controller.
                A 3D printed enclosure for the remote will be designed as well as a 3D printed car base.
                Unfortunately, due to COVID I was not able to manufacture and assemble the PCB but will hopefully have a chance in the fall.

                  <h4>Characterization of the Material Properties of Wood</h4>
                  <p>As an assignment to design an experiment, my group chose to characterize the elastic modulus of Russian birch plywood, typically used for applications like laser cutting.
                    Our experimental setup consisted of a vice with two points of contact supporting our specimen.
                    A load cell was attached to the moving plate of the vice and would measure the load applied at the center of the beam.
                    A linear encoder was attached to the side of the vice, measuring its displacment and thus the maximum deflection of the specimen.
                    Using the model for a simply supported beam and known properties about the specimens, the measured data gave us many quantities for the elastic modulus.
                    These many quantities were used to find a general elastic modulus using a linear fit of the modeled equation.
                    The linear fit gave us the uncertainty bounds for a 95% confidence interval.
                    To take into account the uncertainties in the measuring equipment, we used Gauss' method for quantifying uncertainty at each data point and found the maximum value.
                    Additionally, a full report in ASME format was created outlining the entire experiment and results.

					      <h4>Wireless Deadbolt Unlocker</h4>
					      <p>As a project for the Planar Machinery class, my group chose to go with an external, mechanical deadbolt unlocker.
                  It is much cheaper than on the market smart locks and does not require replacing the entire doorknob, making it useful for renters.
                  I took the lead on the mechanical design, choosing a 3:1 gear ratio to supply more torque from the servo motor and to provide the correct degrees of rotation due to the servo motor's 270 degree range.
                  I took care to choose cheaper parts and to ensure the stack up would be appropriate in the CAD before prototyping.
                  The box and gears were laser cut from acrylic to display what was happening on the inside with bearing press fit into them to ensure the shaft would turn smoothly.
                  As a part of the project, the CAD model was animated and a motion analysis was performed on it using Solidworks.

                    <h4>Modeling and Optimization of UAV Swarms</h4>
                    <p> As an individual class project, I optimized a control law for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to effeciently map (or collect pictures of) all targets while not crashing into each other or any obstacles.
                      This control law was optimized using a genetic algorithm through machine learning to find appropriate weights that would direct the agents (UAVs) in the optimal direction at each time step.
                      To do this, a simulation was constructed to model the behavior of the agents for specific weights.
                      In this simulation, the agents were modeled as point masses experiencing only a propulsion force and drag.
                      If agents got too close to each other or to obstacles they would crash.
                      For a given set of weights, the simulation would output a cost function to score them on their performance. A lower cost indicates a better performance.
                      For the genetic algorithm, 50 sets of weights were randomly generated, run through the simulation and ranked by their cost.
                      The best sets of weights were bred to have offspring which would be paired with more randomly generated sets of weights in the next generation.
                      This was repeated for 100 generations and the resulting simulation is shown in the animation.

                        <p> As an individual class project, I modeled and optimized a free form robotic 3D printer.
                          The printer was simulated to be a robot arm with three links and an extruder at the end.
                          Each link had a fixed length and a constant angular velocity.
                          At the extuder, drops were dispensed every time step with a given extrusion velocity.
                          Once in the air, the drops were subjected to gravity, drag, and electrical forces from the charged print bed.
                          Using Newton's second law, the forces were calculated and the position and velocity of each droplet was updated using Forward Euler numerical integration.
                          Again, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the constant angular velocities of each arm and the extrusion velocity to produce a desired pattern.
                          The further this pattern was from desired, the cost function would output a higher score.

					      <p>To determine if a 3D printed gearbox could be feasible, it was necessary to test the 3D printed material in comparison to traditional gear materials.
                  Due to size constraints on the desired planetary gearbox, the diametral pitch and number of teeth were optimized to create the largest teeth possible.
                  The Markforged 3D printer was used for its carbon fiber infused nylon material and compared to gears of the same pitch and diameter that were made of acetal and aluminum.
                  The setup was created such that one gear was bolted down and the other was free turning.
                  The two gears meshed and the free turning gear was attached to a torque wrench that measured the torque needed to break the teeth.
                  The result was that the 3D printed gear, even with the carbon fiber infused, failed at a far smaller torque than the other gears.

                  Fortunately, our prototyping turned out well and were able to mass produce the gears rather inexpensively.
                  The gear molding process was extensively detailed in a grant application for funding.

					      <h4>Baxter Solving a Tetris Puzzle</h4>
					      <p>This was the final project for the Intro to Robotics class.
                  Our group had Baxter solve a puzzle based on the computer game, tetris, and place the tetris pieces into a frame.
                  The robot would use the AR tags placed on the pieces to determine its location and orientation and then place them in its final location an orientation.
                  My part involved laser cutting the tetris pieces with AR tags as well as helping with determining the AR tracking orientations.

					      <h4>PiE on the Road</h4>
					      <p>This project, through the organization Pioneers in Engineering, is meant to develop a simple robotics learning tool for high school students.
                  I did nearly all of the designing of the mechanical system, from creating the CAD to sourcing the cheapest parts that would still enable high school students a robust structure with design versatility.
                  The object of this kit was to be used in workshops taken to schools where the students will learn about gear ratios and elementary circuits.
                  This year we were able to host 4 workshops using these kits and the students enjoyed racing their new cars that they got to keep.

					      <h4>Robotics Kit Parts Design</h4>
					      <p>As part of the mechanical team, we design the parts that the students build their robots with.
                  The parts have to be versatile so students can use them for many different structures or mechanisms.
                  We made many adjustments to the kit metal parts from previous years including decreasing the hole spacing, changing the bearing blocks from square tubing to C-Channel for easier access, and modifying the base kit design.
                  There was a fair amount of prototyping in making these adjustments.
                  The adjustments to the custom made parts required new engineering drawings so I created the new drawings as well as reached out to many local manufacturers to compare prices and find the cheapest one.
